# 🎵 SQL Project - Music Store Data Analysis

## 📄 Project Overview
In this project, I explored and analyzed a **Music Store** database using **SQL queries**. The objective was to answer a series of easy, moderate, and advanced-level business questions based on the dataset, covering topics such as customer behavior, revenue trends, popular genres, and artist performance.

All queries were executed using **PostgreSQL** through **pgAdmin 4**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL** — Database Management System
- **pgAdmin 4** — PostgreSQL GUI Management Tool

## 📚 Problem Statements
The project was divided into three sets of questions:

### Question Set 1 – Easy
- Find the senior most employee based on job title.
- Identify countries with the most invoices.
- List the top 3 invoice totals.
- Find the city with the best customers based on revenue.
- Identify the best customer (highest spender).

### Question Set 2 – Moderate
- List email, first name, last name, and genre of all Rock music listeners, sorted by email.
- Identify the top 10 artists (rock bands) based on the number of tracks.
- List all tracks longer than the average song length, ordered from longest to shortest.

### Question Set 3 – Advanced
- Calculate the amount spent by each customer on different artists.
